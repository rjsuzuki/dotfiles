# Rjsuzuki's dotfiles
My humble dotfiles for learning and inspiration.

# Philosophy
I like the idea of minamalism in my life, so I try to keep things clean and simple here. 
This collection will only have the most important files to allow the user to make they want from it - "Like an empty canvas".

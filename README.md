# Rjsuzuki's dotfiles
My humble dotfiles for learning and inspiration.

# Philosophy
I like the idea of minamalism in my life, so I try to keep things clean and simple here. 
This collection will only have the most important files to allow the user to make they want from it - "Like an empty canvas".

# Installation
Run:
$ git clone https://github.com/rjsuzuki/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/dotfiles
$ chmod +x setup.sh
$ ./setup.sh
